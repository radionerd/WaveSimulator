# Motion Simulator

## Welcome

This is the repository for the Motion Simulator design files

The design is contained in these folders:

firmware   - Arduino .ino file and screenshot
mechanical - LibreCAD drawings and templates - print the templates, glue on to mdf for cutting and drilling
schematic  - EaglePCB schematics - also provided as pdf
parts      - A list of all the purchased parts

## Arrangement

The motion platform is controlled by an Arduino Nano mounted on the underside.
The Arduino Nano USB serial connection provides opional command line control and a status screen.
An optional plug in control panel provides convenient user controls using switches, potentiometers and an LED.

## Background

The simulator was designed to approximate the pitch, roll and heave motions of a ship at sea using low cost model control servos.
For a higher precision simulation consider a Stewart Plaform with six degrees of freedom using linear actuators and higher cost!
